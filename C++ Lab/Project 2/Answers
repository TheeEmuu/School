Exercise 2:
Nested variables can see the variables of the block they're in
but the outer block can't see them
The difference from Java is that a c++ local variable masks all
previous variables, whereas java won't mask another local variable

Exercise 3:
Global variables are virtually never the right solution to any problem.
Don't use them, no matter how tempting.

Exercise 4:
namespace ns{
    int value = 6;
}

ns::value

Exercise 5:
smallest_circle.h has multiple free functions, such as load_points,
find_center, and find_radius, which are then defined in smallest_circle.cpp

all of point.h functions are member functions and they are implemented
in point.cpp

Exercise 6:
cout << std::setprecision(3) << double << '\n'
